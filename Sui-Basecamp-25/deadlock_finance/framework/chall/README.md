# Deadlock Finance

### Description

Deadlock Finance was designed as a flexible staking protocol — stake your tokens, earn rewards over time, simple as that. But hidden deep in the system is a flaw. One that, if exploited, can lock the entire protocol into a permanent freeze.

Your goal? Trigger a sequence of calls that blocks all reward claims. The contract stays live. Balances remain visible. But no one can claim. Not now. Not ever.

The protocol hasn’t halted... so why is no one getting paid?

### Objective

Make sure users can never unstake their funds.
Ensure to lock the contract permanently. Not even the admin should be able to unlock it.
There must be absolutely no condition, now or in the future, that allows anyone to withdraw anything.
